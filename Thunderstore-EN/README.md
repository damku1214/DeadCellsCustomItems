# Custom Items from the game Dead Cells for Skul: the Hero Slayer

## PLEASE BE AWARE!!!
This project is a variation of MrBacanudo's [Custom Items mod](https://github.com/MrBacanudo/SkulHardModeMods/tree/main/CustomItems).
None of the code belongs to me excluding content related to custom Dead Cells items.

## Content
This mod contains:

* 1 Common
* 1 Rare
* 1 Unique
* 1 Legendary

(I know, it's a fairly small mod)

Each item is designed as:
* An item for fast 2 and 4 treasure completion
* An emergency healing source
* A randomized Masterpiece with a variety of outcomes
* An item for people loving to live on the edge

## Future updates
This mod will probably not going to recieve an update unless I really feel like it.
It was a short passion project anyways, and I'm probably going to stop before I start to force myself through it.

HOWEVER, I do have another future project in mind, so stay tuned!
